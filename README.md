A fun simple Python game created by Connor Calvey. Although I used many open source tools such as Youtube and OpenAi to help me create the game, this project taught
me many diffrent aspects of coding such as troubleshooting and basic principles of coding. I encountered many diffrent errors within the code while I was building the 
game and while some errors took longer then others, I took these errors as a chance to enhance my knowledge about coding and tried to understand why the errors were occuring. In conclusion, I feel as though I learned a lot about coding and hope to help companies with troubleshooting code and learn as much as I possibly can about coding. Good Luck Playing!!!!
